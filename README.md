# Last version Food U App
This is our last version of the Food U App because we're working on improving the coding and applying best practice 

## Improvements
- We implemented Hilt Inyection because it's easier that doing it manul with a Factory Class
- We put light and dark mode in order to improve the user experience
- New Scaffolding with three layers: UI, Data and Domain
- Eventual Connectivity: Database, fetch data with Firestore and login with Firebase
- Multithreading: Dispatch.IO by using Coroutines
